# Financial-Risk-Detection
This project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning to conduct risk analysis for loan default prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their loan payments.
